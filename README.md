# Welcome to the MauiTailscaleGrpc Solution
This solution is an evolution of my ANT+ Class Libraries project. Whimsically, it grew out of my desire to show my friends at the local watering hole what I was working on. I wanted to pull out my phone, launch my fancy MAUI app, connect to my computer at home, interact with the ANT sensors I was simulating on my home computer, and savor a sip of bourbon!

I was looking at various homelab setups and VPNs and came across Tailscale. Tailscale checked all my boxes - free with a decent feature set, simple setup/administration, and secure. I didn't want to open the gates to just any hacker or script kiddie.
